A project that generates custom templates for planners

## System Requirements

## Instructions

To use the project, you first need to configure it, install its dependencies, build it, then run it. To do so, run the following in the project's root directory:

### Configure

The first thing to do is to copy the `config.example.js` file and rename it to `config.js`. There you will configure the script.

The next thing to do is to copy the `dates.example.js` file and rename it to `dates.js`. There you will configure your fixed dates.

### Install

```
npm install

### Only Build

If you only want to build the project without starting it, you can run the following:

```
npm run build
```
